Docco is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style
documentation generator. For more information, see:

http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/

It looks like jashkenas hasn't been updating docco, and I needed it to
support what I needed, so here is my fork.


TODO:

I plan to build in:

* higher number of languages supported (manually adding - short term)

* automatic language detection (much better / long-term)
